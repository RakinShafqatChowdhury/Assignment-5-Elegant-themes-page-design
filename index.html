                <h1>Discover the Difference of Visual Drag & Drop Wordpress Websites</h1>
                <p>Divi is our flagship theme and visual page builder, and the most widely-used premium WordPress theme in the world according to stats from BuiltWith.com. Divi is more than just a theme, it's a website building framework that makes it possible to design beautiful websites without ever touching a single line of code and without installing and configuring dozens of disjointed plugins. We think this is the future of WYSIWYG, and it's unlike any WordPress theme you have used before.

                <h1>The Divi Builder. Visual Drag & Drop Website Building For Any Theme</h1>
                <p>The Divi Builder is a visual drag & drop page builder for WordPress that works with any theme. The Divi Builder plugin takes the visual page builder technology that made our Divi theme such a success, and packages it as a stand-alone plugin that you can use with any theme. Build anything, customize everything, and do it all using an intuitive visual design interface.

No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.

        	</div>

        	<div class="leftfaq">
        		<ul>
        			<li><em>Can I use the themes and plugins on multiple websites?</em></li><br>
        			<li>Yes, you are free to use our themes on as many websites as you like. We do not place any restrictions on how many times you can download or use a theme, nor do we limit the number of domains that you can install our themes to.</li>
        			<br>
        			<br>
        			<br>
        			<br>
        			<br>
        			<li><em>Can I upgrade to a different package after signing up?</em></li><br>
        			<li>Yes, you can upgrade at any time after signing up. When you log in as a "personal" subscriber, you will see a notice regarding your current package and instructions on how to upgrade.</li>
        			<br>
        			<br>
        			<li><em>Can I buy a single theme instead of joining the membership?</em></li><br>
        			<li>Our themes are only available as part of the membership. However, I think you will find that $89 is an incredible deal, even if you only intend to use a single theme from our collection. $89 is less than the price you would pay for a single theme at many other theme shops, and here you get access to a lot more! </li>
        			<br>
        			<br>
        			<li><em>Do I need to install the Divi Builder plugin with the Divi Theme?</em></li><br>
        			<li>Nope, the Divi theme and the Extra theme both come with the Divi Builder packaged as part of the theme. There is no need to use the Divi Builder plugin if you are planning to use one of these two themes. If you ever decide to switch to a different theme after having built your website with Divi or Extra, the Divi Builder plugin can be installed so that you can continue to enjoy the power of the Divi Builder with your third party theme.</li>

        			<li><em>Why choose Elegant Themes?</em></li><br>

        			<br>
        			<br>
        			<li><em>Can I use your themes on WordPress.com</em></li><br>
        			<li>Unfortunately WordPress.com does not allow the use of custom themes. If you would like to use a custom theme of any kind, you will need to purchase your own hosting account and install the free software from WordPress.org. </li>
        			<br>
        			<br>
        			<li><em>Will your themes work with third party plugins?</em></li><br>
        			<li>While our themes should work fine with most plugins, there is no way for us to test and guarantee that all plugins will work. All we can guarantee is that our themes are coded excellently and that any plugin that also uses coding best practices should play well with our themes. If you run into any problems, let us know so that we can look into it. We also offer a 30-day money back guarantee just in case you discover that one of your third party plugins isn't working and you decide to use a different theme instead.</li>
